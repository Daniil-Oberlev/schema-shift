# Migration System Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Improvements (High Priority)

### Configuration
- [ ] **.env file support**
  - Automatic loading of environment variables
  - Fallback to existing env vars if .env not found
- [ ] **Secret management**
  - Integration with vault/secret managers
  - Encrypted secrets for sensitive DB credentials
- [ ] **Required variables validation**
  - Pre-flight check for essential env vars
  - Clear error messages for missing config

### Safety Checks
- [ ] **Database space verification**
  - Minimum space threshold check
  - Warning for <10% free space
- [ ] **Migration integrity check**
  - Hash verification of applied migrations
  - Detection of manual DB changes
- [ ] **SQL syntax validation**
  - Pre-apply syntax checking
  - Basic semantic analysis (e.g. missing semicolons)

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

### Execution Control
- [ ] **Parallel execution lock**
  - File-based or DB-based locking
  - Timeout mechanism for stale locks
- [ ] **Dependency verification**
  - Check required DB extensions
  - Validate PostgreSQL version compatibility

### Environment Support
- [ ] **Docker integration**
  - Ready-to-use Docker image
  - Health checks for containerized DBs
- [ ] **go-migrate version check**
  - Minimum version enforcement
  - Warning for deprecated features

## Phase 3: Operational Excellence (Low Priority)

### Environment Awareness
- [ ] **Environment detection**
  - Auto-detect prod/stage/dev
  - Environment-specific migration rules

### Disaster Recovery
- [ ] **Automated backups**
  - Pre-migration snapshot
  - Point-in-time recovery options

## Phase 4: Future Enhancements

### Monitoring
- Migration duration metrics
- Integration with Prometheus

### Developer Experience
- Dry-run mode
- Interactive confirmation for production
